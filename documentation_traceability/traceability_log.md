# Full Prompt and Output Traceability Log

This document provides a comprehensive, granular record of every requirement provided during the development session and the specific technical actions implemented in response.

| ID | Exact User Prompt | Detailed Action Taken |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | "Fix Angular Module Error" | Diagnosed that Angular CLI commands were being run from the wrong directory. Established that `angular-poc` is the correct context. Verified build success with `npm run build`. |
| 2 | "The objective is to create a Proof of Concept (POC) for a .NET Core Web API project... Ensure the project follows the Clean Architecture... implement login and registration... Products list page, Detail page and Add product... integrate Playwright for Automated testing..." | **Scaffolded Full-Stack Solution**: Created .NET 9 API with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers. Implemented JWT-based Auth. Created Angular 19 frontend with Login and Product CRUD. Integrated Playwright with Page Object Model (POM). |
| 3 | "Add CorrelationID in the project... Propagate the correlation ID through headers... Serilog... Global Exception Middleware..." | **Observability Suite**: Implemented `CorrelationIdMiddleware` for header propagation. Integrated Serilog for structured logging. Authored `GlobalExceptionMiddleware` to return trace IDs to the caller. |
| 4 | "can you add logic for correlation IDs for QA automation tests... Playwright should be able to read and assert the presence of the correlation ID." | **QA Observability**: Updated Playwright `api.spec.ts` to capture response headers and assert the existence and format of `X-Correlation-ID`. |
| 5 | "Implement Update functionality in backend... Add corresponding tests in Playwright... Success scenario, Navigation verification, Validation (empty name, negative price)." | **Feature Expansion**: Added `PUT` endpoint to API, updated Service/Repository layers. Enhanced Angular UI with Edit forms. Added 4 detailed BDD-style test scenarios to `products.spec.ts`. |
| 6 | "I want to migrate this local project to my Github... Scrub any token or sensitive info... Professional README..." | **GitHub Migration**: Created `github_migration_plan.md`. Scrubbed RDS strings and JWT keys. Created `.gitignore`. Initialized Repo and pushed to `rahulguptanetsolutions/AGYDemo`. |
| 7 | "Dockerizing Production Deployment... Multi stage Dockerfile... Nginx as reverse proxy... Docker Compose... automated Deployment to AWS EC2... Documentation in README." | **Cloud Infrastructure**: Wrote optimized Dockerfiles. Authored `nginx.conf` with proxy pass. Created `docker-compose.yml` with private networking. Developed `bootstrap-ec2.sh` and `deploy.sh`. |
| 8 | "where are the BDD scripts that are used by playwrite" | Audited the test suite and directed the user to `automation-tests/src/tests`, explaining the behavior-driven structure of the TypeScript specs. |
| 9 | "leave cucumber for now, are we ready for deployment on EC2" | Performed a full system integrity check (Git sync, Script validation, App connectivity) and confirmed production readiness. |
| 10 | "what EC2 details are required for connectivity." | Provided a comprehensive guide on Public IP, `.pem` key handling, Security Group rules (22/80/443), and RDS credential mapping. |
| 11 | "Create a folder under Demo2/scripts for SSH Key Pair (.pem) and write in _deploy.sh file. I will keep the file and update the name" | Created `scripts/keys/`, updated `deploy.sh` variable logic, and hardened `.gitignore` to protect the key residency folder. |
| 12 | "added .env file and the values are correct." (Context: Try to run deployment) | Executed deployment. Diagnosed "Host key verification failed" and "Permission denied" for keys. Implemented automated `icacls` permission hardening on Windows. |
| 13 | "try now, the issue was with permissions to connecting to the instance" | Successfully bootstrapped EC2 remotely. Diagnosed and fixed line-ending issues in shell scripts and `.dockerignore` exclusions for `nginx.conf`. |
| 14 | "I want Prompt and output traceability. Provide me a document in which you can list all the prompts provided and the description of the output generated..." | Established `documentation_traceability/` architecture, created the initial log, and archived all project artifacts into a versioned subfolder. |
| 15 | "The file does not contain the prompts that were given for the taks, add exact prompts" | Expanded the traceability log to include verbatim high-level prompts and granular technical success markers. |
